                <h2>Once in your life you need a doctor, a lawyer, a policeman and a preacher but every day, three times a day, you need a farmer.<br /> - Brenda Schoepp</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>1)</b> Farming began around 10,000 B.C. during the First Agricultural Revolution, when nomadic tribes began to farm. Additionally, this is when the eight so-called “founder crops” of agriculture appeared: 1) emmer wheat, 2) einkorn wheat, 3) hulled barley, 4) peas, 5) lentils, 6) bitter vetch, 7) chickpeas, and 8) flax. <br /> <br /><b>2)</b> The Industrial Revolution led to faster and more efficient farming technology, which helped usher in the Second Agricultural Revolution from 1700 to 1900 in developed countries. <br /> Many less developed countries are still experiencing the Second Agricultural Revolution.
                    <br /><br /><b>3)</b> The Third Agricultural Revolution, or the Green Revolution, corresponds in the late 20th century with the exponential population growth occurring around the world. It includes biotechnology, genetic engineering, chemical fertilizers, and mass production of agricultural goods.
                    <br /><br /><b>4)</b> Subsistence farmers are farmers who produce the food they need to survive on a daily basis. They are farmers who raise enough food for themselves and their families. The food is not intended to be sold in a market.[14]
                    <br /><br /><b>5)</b> Fruit farming began sometime between 6000 and 3000 B.C. Figs were one of the first cultivated fruit crops.

                <p><b>6)</b> Modern tractor had been developed. With different attachments, tractors can be used for plowing, planting, cultivating, mowing, harvesting, and moving soil and heavy equipment. <br /> <br /><b>7)</b> Farmers often plant tall, dense trees on the edges of fruit farms. These trees provide a windbreak, which helps prevent soil erosion.<br /><br /><b>8)</b> The tallest, biggest trees or bushes do not always yield the most fruit.<br /><br /><b>9)</b> Controlling the height of plants helps produce more fruit in less space. Farmers may also change a tree’s shape by cutting branches or forcing branches to grow in a certain direction. The shape of the tree affects its lifespan and the size of its fruit.<br /><br /><b>10)</b> Bananas are the number one fruit crop in the world. They are the 4th largest overall crop, after wheat, rice, and corn.  India grows more bananas than any other country. The Philippines, China, and Ecuador are the next three top producers of bananas.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>11)</b> Farmers today produce 262% more food with 2% fewer inputs (such as seeds, labor, fertilizers) than they did in 1950. One in three farm acres is planted for export.<br /><br /><b>12)</b> Farming employs more than 24 million American workers (17% of the total workforce). <br /><br /><b>13)</b> According to many historians, goats were the first animal to be domesticated. Goats are typically the cleanest of animals. They are much more select feeders than cows, chickens, or even dogs. They typically will not eat food that has been contaminated or that has been on the floor or ground.<br /><br /><b>14)</b> Pigs, a common farm animal, are thought to be the 4th most intelligent animal, after chimps, dolphins, and elephants. A group of pigs is called a sounder. Pigs can also run 11 miles per hour, which is faster than a 6-minute mile.
                    <br /><br /><b>15)</b> More than 100 agricultural crops in India are pollinated by bees. In fact, one out of three bites of food people eat is thanks to honeybees.

                    <br /><br /><b>18)</b> Seeds had to be scattered by hand until Jethro Tull’s seed drill (developed in 1701) made it possible to plant seeds in rows, which could then be easily hoed.
                    <br /><br /><b>19)</b> Today’s farmers grow more than “food, feed, and fiber”—they also grow crops that are processed into fuel. For example, corn can be made into ethanol and soybean oil can be made into diesel fuel.
                    <br /><br /><b>20)</b> The word “farm” is from the Old French ferme, meaning to “rent, lease,” and the Latin firmare, “to fix, settle, confirm, strengthen.”

                    <b>76)</b> Over the past 25 years, U.S.-manufactured goods exports have quadrupled. In 1990, for example, U.S. manufacturers exported $329.5 billion in goods.
                    <br /> <br /><b>77</b> By 2000, that number had more than doubled to $708.0 billion.
                    <br /><br /><b>78)</b> In 2014, it reached an all-time high, for the fifth consecutive year, of $1.403 trillion, despite slowing global growth. With that said, a number of economic headwinds have dampened export demand since then, with U.S.-manufactured goods exports down 6.1 percent in 2015 to $1.317 trillion.
                    <br /><br /><b>79)</b> Manufactured goods exports have grown substantially to our largest trading partners since 1990, including to Canada, Mexico and even China. Moreover, free trade agreements are an important tool for opening new markets.
                    <br /><br /><b>80)</b> The United States enjoyed a $12.7 billion manufacturing trade surplus with its trade agreement partners in 2015, compared with a $639.6 billion deficit with other countries.

                    <b>81)</b> Nearly half of all manufactured goods exports went to nations that the U.S. has free trade agreements (FTAs) with.
                    <br /> <br /><b>82</b> In 2015, manufacturers in the U.S. exported $634.6 billion in goods to FTA countries, or 48.2 percent of the total.
                    <br /><br /><b>83)</b> World trade in manufactured goods has more than doubled between 2000 and 2014—from $4.8 trillion to $12.2 trillion.
                    <br /><br /><b>84)</b> World trade in manufactured goods greatly exceeds that of the U.S. market for those same goods. U.S. consumption of manufactured goods (domestic shipments and imports) equaled $4.1 trillion in 2014, equaling about 34 percent of global trade in manufactured goods.
                    <br /><br /><b>85)</b> Taken alone, manufacturing would be the ninth-largest economy in the world. With $2.1 trillion in value added from manufacturing in 2014, only eight other nations (including the U.S.) would rank higher in terms of their gross domestic product.

                    <b>86)</b> Foreign direct investment in manufacturing exceeded $1.2 trillion for the first time ever in 2015. Across the past decade, foreign direct investment has more than doubled, up from $499.9 billion in 2005 to $1,222.9 billion in 2015. Moreover, that figure is likely to continue growing, especially when we consider the number of announced ventures that have yet to come online.
                    <br /> <br /><b>87</b> U.S. affiliates of foreign multi-national enterprises employ more than 2 million manufacturing workers in the United States, or almost one-sixth of total employment in the sector.
                    <br /><br /><b>88)</b> In 2012, the most recent year with data, manufacturing sectors with the largest employment from foreign multi-nationals included motor vehicles and parts (322,600), chemicals (319,700), machinery (222,200), food (216,200), primary and fabricated metal products (176,800), computer and electronic products (154,300) and plastics and rubber products (151,200).
                    <br /><br /><b>89)</b> Manufacturers perform more than three-quarters of all private-sector research and development (R&D) in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. R&D in the manufacturing sector has risen from $126.2 billion in 2000 to $229.9 billion in 2014.
                    <br /><br /><b>90)</b> Manufacturers consume more than 30 percent of the nation’s energy consumption. Industrial users consumed 31.5 quadrillion Btu of energy in 2014, or 32 percent of the total.

                    <b>91)</b> The cost of federal regulations fall disproportionately on manufacturers, particularly those that are smaller.
                    <br /> <br /><b>92)</b> Manufacturers pay $19,564 per employee on average to comply with federal regulations, or nearly double the $9,991 per employee costs borne by all firms as a whole. In addition, small manufacturers with less than 50 employees spend 2.5 times the amount of large manufacturers. Environmental regulations account for 90 percent of the difference in compliance costs between manufacturers and the average firm.
                    <br /><br /><b>93)</b> Manufacturing leads our country out of economic turmoil.
                    <br /><br /><b>94)</b> This fact is attributed to the 5.8 million jobs in other sectors that depend on, and are supported by, the manufacturing industry.
                    <br /><br /><b>95)</b> This includes workforces from professional services, wholesaling, transportation, agriculture and finance sectors. In fact, as the fourth largest employer in the country, the U.S. manufacturing sector provides more than 11.7 million jobs. It also boasts the world's 10th largest economy, surpassing the entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India, Canada or Australia.

                    <b>96)</b> Even though healthcare premiums have more than doubled since 1999, manufacturing has kept apace with its benefit contributions, which also includes such wellness programs as smoking cessation, on-site exercise facilities or gym memberships.
                    <br /> <br /><b>97</b> Manufacturing employees out-earn workers in other industries. Salaries in manufacturing (an average of $32.93 per hour) are 8 percent higher compared to the combined salary averages across all other industries ($30.44 per hour). But it's not just pay that stands out?manufacturers are a leader in providing healthcare benefits to employees and their families; only state and local government employers offer a higher percentage of benefits.
                    <br /><br /><b>98)</b> Manufacturers recognize that safety programs ultimately reduce costs, increase productivity, and improve efficiency and morale, all of which contribute to the bottom line. Employees also help create safer work environments indirectly through their participation in the company-funded wellness programs.
                    <br /><br /><b>99)</b> In the most recent data, pharmaceuticals accounted for nearly one-third of all manufacturing R&D, spending $74.9 billion in 2014. Aerospace, chemicals, computers, electronics and motor vehicles and parts were also significant contributors to R&D spending in that year.
                    <br /><br /><b>100)</b> Manufacturing raises the bar on safety standards. Occupational injuries reported throughout manufacturing worksites decreased by two-thirds over a 15-year period, which is a faster rate of improvement compared to that of the overall private sector.
